# Weather App

A simple desktop application built with Python and PyQt5 that fetches and displays weather information for a user-specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. The app shows the temperature in Celsius, a weather emoji, and a brief description of the weather conditions.

## Features

1. Enter a city name to get real-time weather data.
2. Displays temperature in Â°C, a corresponding weather emoji, and a description.
3. User-friendly GUI with custom styling.
4. Robust error handling for network issues, invalid inputs, and API errors.
